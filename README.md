# midi-fpga-keyboard
This project implements a musical keyboard on an FPGA, written entirely in VHDL. It targets the Nexys4 board, using the onboard switches as keys.

This project perfectly mixes the two main fields I want to focus on : signal processing and digtal electronics.

This is a second-year digital electronics project with the following objectives:
  - to enhance our ability to design more advanced digital systems
  - to deepen our knowledge of the VHDL language
  - to develop teamwork skills
